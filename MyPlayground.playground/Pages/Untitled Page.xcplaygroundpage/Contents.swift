 ## Welcome to your playground

 Imagine that I ask you to remember the number 5. Now remember my name, "John". Now remember the number 7. What is the first number I asked you to remember times 2? what is that number plus the second number I gave you? 
 \
 As you can see, managing all of this information can get complicated very fast. Computers, on the other hand, are built to do this(so we don't have too!).
 \
 If we want to have a computer remember something for us, we need to create a variable. A variable is a peice of memory that contains something. 
 \
 We tell a computer to do this with this instruction.
 \
 `var (name) = (value)`
 \
 What this tells the computer to do is "remember (name) whose value is (value)". 
 \
 Now, if we want to ask the computer for the value all we need to do is use the name. 
 \
 `(name)`

var age = 32
var name = "John"
age
name
/*:
 We can also tell to computer to change a variable.
 */
age = 33
/*:
 - Note:
 to help the computer out, make sure variable names do not include
 \
  whitespace characters, such as " "
 \
  mathematical symbols
 \
  arrows
 \
  or start with numbers
