 # Introduction to Coding
 ## Welcome to your playground
 
 ---
 This is how you create a Variable in your playground.
 \
 `var (name) = (value)`
 \
a variable can be named anything with letters and/or numbers in it. such as
 \
 `var arms = 2`
 \
 or 
 \
 `var pet = "dog"`
 \
 The value, as you can see, can be any number or a word/phrase surrounded in "quotes".
 \
 Variable names cannot include 
 - whitespace characters, such as " ".
 - mathematical symbols
 - arrows
 
 ---
 Lets start by making some Variables in the space below.
 */
var age = 32
var name = "John"

/*:
 Variables are called 'variable' for a reason; we can change them.
 */
age = 33
/*: 
 If we want to create a temporary value, also called a literal(think "literally this"), we would define it as 
 \
 `33` or `"John"`
 \
 The difference between literals and variables is that literals are for one-time use and variables can be used repeatedly.
 \
 So when we make a variable, we assign it's value to a literal.
 */
33
"John"

 when you are ready to continue, press [Next](@next).
