 # Introduction to Coding
 ## Welcome to your playground
 
 ---
 Imagine that you are asked to remember the number 5. Now remember my name, "John". Now remember the number 7. What is the first number I asked you to remember times 2? what is that number plus the second number I gave you?
 \
 As you can see, managing all of this information can get complicated very fast. Computers, on the other hand, are built to do this(so we don't have too!).
 \
 If we want to have a computer remember something for us, we need to create a `variable`. `A variable` is a piece of memory that contains a value.
 \
 We tell a computer to do this with this instruction.
 \
 `var (name) = (value)`
 \
 This tells the computer to remember `name` whose value is `value`.
 \
 Now, if we want to ask the computer for the value all we need to do is use type `name`.
 */
var age = 32
var name = "John"
age
name
/*:
 We can also tell the to computer to change a variable.
 */
age = 33
/*:
 - Note:
 to help the computer out, make sure variable names do not include
 \
 -whitespace characters, such as " "
 \
 -mathematical symbols
 \
 -arrows
 \
 -or start with numbers
 */
/*:
 Try creating a variable below named `dog` that has value "Spot".
