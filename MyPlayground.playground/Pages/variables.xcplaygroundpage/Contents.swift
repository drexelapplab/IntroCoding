 # Introduction to Coding
 ## Welcome to your playground
 
 ---
 Imagine that you are asked to remember the number 5. Now remember my name, "John". Now remember the number 7. What is the first number I asked you to remember times 2? what is that number plus the second number I gave you?
 \
 As you can see, managing all of this information can get complicated very fast. Computers, on the other hand, are built to do this(so we don't have too).
 \
 If we want to have a computer remember something for us, we need to create a `variable`. A `variable` is a piece of memory that contains a value.
 ## Variables
 We tell a computer to remember a `variable` like this.
 ````
 var (name) = (value)
 ````
 This tells the computer to remember `name` whose value is `value`. Now, whenever the computer sees `name` in code, it will remember it as its `value`.
 - Note: 
 `(name)` means that you can use any `variable` name here. `Variable` names can be anything but cannot include the following:
 \
 \- whitespace characters, such as " ".
 \
 \- arithmetic symbols, such as `+` or `-`.
 \
 \- arrows.
 \
 \- start with numbers.
 \
 `(value)` can be any value. For now, values can be words/phrases surrounded by quotes or numbers.

 Here are a few `variables`.

var age = 32
var name = "John"
/*:
 We can also tell the to computer to change a `variable`.
 */
age = 33
/*:
 Try creating a `variable` in the space below named `dog` that has value "Spot".
